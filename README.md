# jboss-autopwn
JBoss Autopwn as featured at BlackHat Europe 2010 - this version incorporates CVE-2010-0738 the JBoss authentication bypass VERB manipulation vulnerability as discovered by Minded Security

C. Papathanasiou 2010


INTRODUCTION
============

This JBoss script deploys a JSP shell on the target JBoss AS server. Once 
deployed, the script uses its upload and command execution capability to
provide an interactive session.

Features include:

- Multiplatform support - tested on Windows, Linux and Mac targets
- Support for bind and reverse bind shells
- Meterpreter shells and VNC support for Windows targets

INSTALLATION
============

Dependencies include

- Netcat
- Curl
- Metasploit v3, installed in the current path as "framework3"

USAGE
=====

Use e.sh for *nix targets that use bind_tcp and reverse_tcp
```
./e.sh target_ip tcp_port
```
Use e2.sh for Windows targets that can execute Metasploit Windows payloads
```
/e2.sh target_ip tcp_port
```

EXAMPLES
